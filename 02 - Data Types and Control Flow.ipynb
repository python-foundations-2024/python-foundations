    "#### Common String methods and their usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some commonly used string methods in Python, along with their basic usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `casefold()` and `lower()`: Converts the string to lowercase, which can be used for caseless matching\n",
    "- `capitalize()` and and `upper()`: Converts the first character of a string or all the characters to uppercase.\n",
    "- `replace(old, new[, count])`: Returns a string where a specified value is replaced with a specified value.\n",
    "- `center(width[, fillchar])`: Centers the string in a field of specified width.\n",
    "- `split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)`: Splits the string at the specified separator and returns a list.\n",
    "- `join(iterable)`: Converts the elements of an iterable (like a list) into a string.\n",
    "- `strip([chars])`: Returns a trimmed version of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using string methods, it's important to remember that strings in Python are immutable. This means that the original string is not modified. Instead, these methods return new string objects with the applied changes. To reflect these changes, you must assign the result to a new variable or overwrite the existing one."

    "#### Length of a string\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use `len(str)` instead of `str.length()` for several reasons related to Python's design philosophy and object-oriented principles. Here’s a friendly breakdown of why this is the case:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Built-in Function vs. Method**\n",
    " - **Built-in Function**: `len()` is a built-in function in Python, designed to provide a uniform way to get the length of various data types, including strings, lists, tuples, and more. Using a function allows it to be more general-purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Method**: In many object-oriented programming languages (like Java or JavaScript), you often see methods tied to an object, like `str.length()`. However, Python takes a different approach by implementing certain operations as functions rather than methods to provide a more uniform interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Uniformity Across Data Types**\n",
    "Consistent Interface: By using a function like `len()`, Python maintains a consistent way to access the length of different data types. This means you can call `len()` on a **string**, **list**, **tuple**, or **dictionary** without needing to remember different method names for each type."

    "#### Slicing and indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "String slicing and indexing in Python are powerful tools that allow you to access and manipulate parts of a string easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexing** refers to accessing individual characters in a string using their position, where the first character has an index of 0, the second character has an index of 1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "  You can also use negative indexing, which counts from the end of the string, with -1 representing the last character.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For example, in the string `text = \"Hello\"`, `text[0]` returns 'H', and `text[-1]` returns 'o'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, **slicing** allows you to extract a substring by specifying a start and end index using the format `string[start:end]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The substring will include characters from the start index up to, but not including, the end index. For instance, `text[1:4]` gives you 'ell'. You can also omit the start or end index to slice from the beginning or to the end of the string, respectively.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Additionally, you can use a third parameter, the step, to skip characters.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For example, `text[::2]` would return every second character, resulting in 'Hlo'. This flexibility makes string slicing and indexing essential for text manipulation in Python!"

    "### Tuples 📦\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are one of the fundamental data structures in Python. They are similar to lists but with one key difference: tuples are **immutable**, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created. This makes tuples useful in scenarios where you want to ensure that the data remains constant throughout the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics of Tuples:\n",
    "- Immutable: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed.\n",
    "- Ordered: Tuples maintain the order of elements, allowing you to access elements by their position (index).\n",
    "- Heterogeneous: Tuples can store different types of data, such as strings, integers, floats, etc.\n",
    "- Parentheses Notation: Tuples are created using parentheses `()` and commas to separate elements.\n",

    "my_tuple = (1,)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Uses of Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Integrity: Since tuples are immutable, they are used to store data that shouldn't be modified. For example, geographical coordinates or fixed configurations can be stored in tuples.\n",
    "- Return Multiple Values from Functions: Tuples are commonly used in Python functions to return more than one value.\n",
    "- Dictionary Keys: Since tuples are hashable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries, while lists cannot be used for this purpose.\n",

    "- **Unordered**: The elements in a set do not have a defined order, and their position can change.\n",
    "- **Mutable**: You can add or remove elements from a set after it has been created.\n",
    "- **Unique Elements**: Sets automatically eliminate duplicate entries, meaning each element must be distinct.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Size**: Sets can grow and shrink in size as you add or remove elements.\n",
    "- **Hashing for Efficiency**: Sets are hashed, allowing for constant-time complexity $ \\mathcal{O}(1) $ for basic operations like add, remove and check.\n",

    "# Example: Counting distinct elements in a survey response\n",
    "responses = ['yes', 'no', 'yes', 'maybe', 'no', 'no']\n",

    "In a retail or e-commerce business, understanding customer behavior is essential for effective marketing strategies. By segmenting customers based on their purchase history, businesses can tailor their marketing efforts to meet the specific needs of different customer groups. Using sets allows for efficient identification of customers who belong to multiple segments, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to Implement Customer Segmentation Using Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Gather customer purchase data, which may include details such as customer IDs, product categories purchased, transaction amounts, and dates. For this challenge we are going to use the following categories: Electronics, Clothing, Home\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Customer Segments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Create customer segments based on the purchase category\n",
    "Example segments:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "electronics_segment = {\"customer1\", \"customer3\", \"customer5\"}\n",
    "clothing_segment = {\"customer2\", \"customer4\", \"customer5\"}\n",

    "3. **Identify Customers in Multiple Segments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Use `set` operations to find customers who belong to more than one segment. This is valuable for understanding cross-category interests and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analyze the Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Analyze the identified multi-segment customers to understand their buying patterns, preferences, and potential for upselling or cross-selling.\n",
    "  For example, if customer5 is a frequent buyer who purchases in multiple categories, targeted marketing campaigns can include bundled offers that feature both electronics and clothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Develop Targeted Marketing Strategies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Create personalized marketing campaigns based on the identified multi-segment customers. These strategies could include:\n",
    "    - Cross-Promotions: Offer discounts or bundle deals on products from different segments they have shown interest in.\n",
    "    - Loyalty Programs: Provide rewards for customers who purchase across multiple categories, encouraging them to explore more products.\n",
    "    - Personalized Recommendations: Use data analytics to suggest products based on their purchase history across different segments, enhancing the shopping experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Measure Effectiveness:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing targeted marketing strategies, track the performance and engagement of campaigns to assess their impact on sales and customer loyalty.\n",
    "Use feedback and data analytics to refine segments and marketing tactics for continuous improvement.\n",

    "\n",
    "Handling exceptions in Python is essential for writing robust and error-resistant code.\n",
    "You can manage exceptions using the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    x = int(input(\"Please enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    print(f\"You entered: {x}\")\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    # Code that runs if the exception occurs\n",
    "    print(\"That's not a valid number! Please try again.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `try`: This block contains the code that might throw an exception.\n",
    "- `except`: This block is executed if an exception occurs in the try block.\n",
    "You can specify the type of exception to catch (e.g., ValueError, TypeError).\n",
    "You can also catch multiple exceptions or use a general exception.\n",
    "- `else` (optional): This block runs if no exceptions are raised in the try block.\n",
    "- `finally` (optional): This block will execute regardless of whether an exception occurred, typically used for cleanup actions.\n",

    "    num1 = int(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n",
