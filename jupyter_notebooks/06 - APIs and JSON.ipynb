    "When communicating between computers, data must traverse several intermediary points in the network. üñ•Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏èüñ•Ô∏è This can include devices like routers and modems, which facilitate the exchange of information between the two machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we want to send undergoes several transformations before reaching its destination, starting from our code. This is where layers of abstraction come into play, representing the same data in different ways. Let's explore these layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Physical Layer** (Low Level) üîå\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this layer, data is represented as ones and zeros in binary format. It is the foundation of all digital communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Network/Transport Layer** (Medium Level) üì¶\n",
    "\n",
    "  Here, data is grouped into packets. The ones and zeros from the lower layers are organized according to predefined rules to form these packets. A key protocol in this layer is TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), which establishes the rules for how packets are transmitted between computers.

    "An IP address is a unique identifier for a computer on the Internet, such as 56.12.32.01. However, when we analyze the numbers more closely, we realize there aren‚Äôt as many possibilities as there are Internet users worldwide. So, how many possibilities are there? And how does the IP system work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break it down with some calculations!\n",
    "\n",
    "Each segment of an IPv4 address can range from 0 to 255, giving us 256 options per segment.\n",

    "In a simplified scenario, we can identify many \"local networks\" within the vast expanse of the Internet. For instance, consider a network where 10 computers (or devices) connect to a router. In these local networks, the router is responsible for assigning private IP addresses to each device.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Private IP Addresses**: These addresses are unique only within the local network. This means that the same private IP address can be used in different local networks without conflict. Common ranges for private IP addresses include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255\n",
    "  - 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255\n",
    "  - 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Public IP Address**: The router has a single public IP address that communicates with the rest of the Internet. This public address is unique across the entire Internet and is how the network is identified externally."

    "### How Routers Manage Connections\n",
    "The router maintains a \"table\" of addresses to direct all the packets that pass through it. This is crucial for ensuring that data reaches the correct destination within local and external networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge of Multiple Programs**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there‚Äôs still a challenge: what happens if two programs on the same computer want to communicate with the same external IP address? How does the router and the computer know which packets belong to which program?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Sockets\n",
    "\n",
    "A socket is an endpoint for sending and receiving data across a network. It is defined by an IP address and a port number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Port Numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Each program (or service) on a computer uses a unique port number to distinguish its communication.\n",
    "  For instance, when a web browser and an email client both connect to the same external IP, they will each use different port numbers (e.g., 80 for HTTP and 25 for SMTP).\n",
    "  This way, the router can identify which packets belong to which application based on the combination of the IP address and the port number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Network Address Translation (NAT):\n",
    "\n",
    "  NAT is the technology that allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address.\n",
    "  When data packets are sent from the computer to the router, the router changes the source IP address to its own public IP and assigns a unique port number for each outgoing connection.\n",
    "  When responses come back, the router uses its table to match the incoming packets to the correct internal IP and port number, ensuring that they are forwarded to the correct program.\n",

    "  - The data exchanged usually includes hypertext documents, images, videos, form data, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requests and Responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A typical interaction involves the client making a request (e.g., requesting a webpage), and the server responding with the requested data.\n",

    "- `json.loads()`: Parses JSON data from a string.\n",
    "- `json.dump()`: Writes JSON data to a file.\n",

    "### Serializing Python Objects to JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about text formats, serialization is the process of converting an object into its string representation. This is often done because the exchange of information, whether over the web or via a cable, is conducted in a serialized format using strings or bytes. The same applies to the JSON format. In Python code, a JSON represents a dictionary, but to transmit it, it must be converted into a string.\n",
