    "# Key Statistical Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean\n",
    "The mean is the average of a dataset and is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the total number of observations. It provides a central value of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a data analytics scenario, suppose we have the following sales data for a week (in thousands of dollars): [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]. The mean or average will be 20\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sales = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]\n",
    "mean_sales = sum(sales) / len(sales)\n",
    "print(f\"Mean Sales:{mean_sales}\") # Output: Mean Sales: 20.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Median\n",
    "The median is the middle value of a dataset when sorted in ascending order. It is useful in datasets that may contain outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider customer ages: [22,25,29,50,35], the median age, the one in the middle is 29\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ages = [22, 25, 29, 50, 35]\n",
    "sorted_ages = sorted(ages)\n",
    "n = len(sorted_ages)\n",
    "median_age = sorted_ages[n // 2] if n % 2 != 0 else (sorted_ages[n // 2 - 1] + sorted_ages[n // 2]) / 2\n",
    "print(f\"Median Age: {median_age}\") # Output: Median Age: 29\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mode\n",
    "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It is particularly useful for categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "In a survey about favorite fruits, the responses are:\n",
    "[\"Apple\",\"Banana\",\"Apple\",\"Orange\",\"Banana\",\"Banana\"]\n",
    "The mode, or the most frequent value is \"Banana\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from statistics import mode\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Banana\", \"Banana\"]\n",
    "mode_fruit = mode(fruits)\n",
    "print(f\"Mode of Fruits:{mode_fruit}\") # Output: Mode of Fruits: Banana\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Variance\n",
    "Variance measures how far each number in the dataset is from the mean and indicates the degree of spread in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "In analyzing test scores: [80,85,90,95,100]\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean =\n",
    "$\\frac{80 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 100}{5}$ = $\\frac{450}{5}$ = 90\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the Squared Differences from the Mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $(80-90)^2 = 100$\n",
    "- $(85-90)^2 = 25$\n",
    "- $(90-90)^2 = 0$\n",
    "- $(95-90)^2 = 25$\n",
    "- $(100-90)^2 = 100$\n",
    "\n",
    "Sum the Squared Differences:\n",
    "100+25+0+25+100=250\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the Variance (using sample variance, which divides by $n−1$):\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance = $\\frac{250}{5 - 1}$ = $\\frac{250}{4}$ = 62.5\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scores = [80, 85, 90, 95, 100]\n",
    "mean_score = sum(scores) / len(scores)\n",
    "variance = sum((x - mean_score) ** 2 for x in scores) / (len(scores) - 1)\n",
    "print(f\"Variance of Scores: {variance}\") # Output: Variance of Scores: 62.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Standard Deviation\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of the average distance of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same test scores:\n",
    "[80,85,90,95,100] the standard deviation is $\\sqrt{62.5}$ = 7.9\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)\n",
    "print(f\"Standard Deviation of Scores: {std_dev}\") # Output: Standard Deviation of Scores: 7.905694150420948\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Quantiles\n",
    "Quantiles divide a dataset into equal-sized subsets. For instance, quartiles divide the data into four equal parts.\n",
    "Quantiles are useful to identify outliers in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following exam scores:\n",
    "[60,70,80,90,100]\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scores = [60, 70, 80, 90, 100]\n",

    "#Dataframes\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**What is a DataFrame?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A DataFrame is essentially a two-dimensional, labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. This versatility allows users to work with heterogeneous data types within a single structure, making dataframes very powerful for data science and machine learning.\n",

    "**Key characteristics of a DataFrame:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two-dimensional: It has rows and columns, which gives it a tabular structure.\n",
    "- Labeled axes: Rows and columns can be labeled, making it easy to reference parts of the DataFrame by name rather than by position.\n",
    "- Flexible data types: Each column can hold a different data type (e.g., integers, floats, strings, dates).\n",

    "### Installing pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing pandas depends on the environment you're using.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In Jupyter notebooks, if you need to update pandas to a specific version, you can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # Install or update pandas to last version\n",
    "  !pip install pandas --upgrade\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Run this in a Colab cell, and it will install or update pandas to the latest version.\n",
    "\n",
    "  You can install a especific version of pandas using the `==` syntax.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # Install a certain version of pandas\n",
    "  !pip install pandas==1.5.3\n",
    "```\n",
    "> **Google Colab** comes with pandas pre-installed, so you typically don't need to install it manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Installing Pandas in Jupyter Notebook or Local Python Environment\n",
    "If you’re working locally in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment (like PyCharm, VS Code, etc.), you can use `pip to install pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Open a terminal and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip install pandas\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  If you want a specific version of pandas, specify it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip install pandas==1.5.3\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Installing Pandas in Anaconda\n",
    "If you’re using Anaconda, it’s often best to install pandas via the `conda` package manager, which manages dependencies more effectively within the Anaconda ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Using Conda\n",
    "  Open the Anaconda Prompt and enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  conda install pandas\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This will install pandas and any required dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "  If you want a specific version of pandas, you can specify it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  conda install pandas=1.5.3\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Creating a New Environment with Pandas\n",
    "  You can also create a new conda environment with pandas pre-installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  conda create -n myenv pandas\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Replace `myenv` with your desired environment name. To activate the environment, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  conda activate myenv\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Verifying the Installation\n",
    "To check that pandas installed correctly, open a Python environment (Colab, Jupyter, or terminal) and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import pandas as pd\n",
    "  print(pd.__version__)  # This should display the installed pandas version\n",

This involves cleaning the dataset by removing outliers and correcting data issues, followed by visualizing the results with a scatter plot and a regression line.\n",
    "\n",
    "High-Level Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Cleaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Identify and filter out outlier trips with excessive trip distances (greater than 200 kilometers).\n",
    "  - Convert any negative values in the total_amount column to their absolute values to ensure all amounts are non-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between total_amount and trip_distance.\n",
    "  - Set appropriate titles and labels for clarity, including a grid for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regression Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Calculate the linear regression line to understand the correlation between the two variables. Use `numpy.polyfit()` to obtain the slope and intercept.\n",
    "  - Generate a range of x-values for the regression line based on the cleaned total_amount data.\n",
    "  - Calculate the corresponding y-values using the linear regression equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Final Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Plot the regression line over the scatter plot to illustrate the relationship between the total amount charged and trip distance.\n",
    "  Display the final plot with proper layout adjustments for optimal viewing.\n",
    "\n",
